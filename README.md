# Supplementary Photographic Data: Behavioral Events in Daiba Park Experiment

This repository contains suplimentary information and photographs documenting the locations of utterances indicating behavioral events analyzed in the paper "**Divergent Environmental Evaluation Patterns in Immersive Virtual vs. Physical Outdoor Environments: Towards Informing Architectural Design in VR**".

## Folder Structure
- `/Physical_Environment/`: (1) Photos from the real-world Odaiba Park, taken at moment of utterance. Each photo is captioned with its corrosponding verbal protocol. (2) /BDI_Strings/: This folder contains the high resolution version the BDI strings and movement maps of each physical park participant, referenced in Figure 8.
- `/Immersive_Virtual_Environment/`: Screenshots from the Unreal Engine replica, taken at moment of utterance. Each photo is captioned with its corrosponding verbal protocol. (2) /BDI_Strings/: This folder contains the high resolution version the BDI strings and movement maps of each virtual park participant, referenced in Figure 8.

## Event Categories
- **Failure_Events**: Participants' unsuccessful actions and perceived failures
- **Risk_Amplification**: Locations where users overestimated environmental threats
- **Reward_Amplification**: Sites where users showed excessive confidence in rewards
- **Impulsive_Action_Chains**: Areas triggering unplanned behavioral sequences

- **There are no observed "Reward_Amplification" events in physical space**
  
## Naming Convention
Photos follow this format: `[PS or IVE]_[EventType]_[ParticipantID]_[Count].png`
Example: `PS_Failure_P1_01.png`
BDI Strings follow this format: `[ParticipantID]`
Example: `P1`

## Correspondence with Paper
Refer to Figure 8 in the paper for event frequency and spatial mapping data.
