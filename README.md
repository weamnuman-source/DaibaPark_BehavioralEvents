# Supplementary Photographic Data: Behavioral Events in Odaiba Park Experiment

This repository contains photographs documenting the locations of utterances indicating behavioral events analyzed in the paper "Divergent Environmental Evaluation Patterns in Immersive Virtual vs. Physical Outdoor Environments: Towards Informing Architectural Design in VR".

## Folder Structure
- `/Physical_Environment/`: Photos from the real-world Odaiba Park, taken at moment of utterance. Each photo is captioned with its corrosponding verbal protocol.
- `/Immersive_Virtual_Environment/`: Screenshots from the Unreal Engine replica, taken at moment of utterance. Each photo is captioned with its corrosponding verbal protocol.

## Event Categories
- **Failure_Events**: Participants' unsuccessful actions and perceived failures
- **Risk_Amplification**: Locations where users overestimated environmental threats
- **Reward_Amplification**: Sites where users showed excessive confidence in rewards
- **Impulsive_Action_Chains**: Areas triggering unplanned behavioral sequences

- **There are no observed "Reward_Amplification" events in physical space**
  
## Naming Convention
Photos follow this format: `[PS or IVE]_[EventType]_[ParticipantID]_[Count].png`
Example: `PS_Failure_P1_01.png`

## Correspondence with Paper
Refer to Figure 5 in the main paper for event frequency and spatial mapping data.
